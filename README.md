# -Basic-Weather-App
This project aims to develop a basic weather application using Python, providing users with current weather information for a specified location.
Key Components:
Weather Data Retrieval: Utilize a weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap) to retrieve current weather data for a given location.
User Input Handling: Prompt users to input the location (e.g., city name) for which they want to check the weather.
Data Parsing: Parse the retrieved weather data to extract relevant information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.
